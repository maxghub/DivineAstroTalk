If you want to run the React.js project from the GitHub link DivineAstroTalk on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/maxghub/DivineAstroTalk.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the repository, navigate into the project folder:


cd DivineAstroTalk
3. Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)
Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system. You can check their versions by running:

node -v
npm -v
If they are not installed, download Node.js from here.

4. Install Project Dependencies
Once you are inside the project directory, run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies (from package.json):

npm install
This will install all the packages required to run the project.

5. Check for Required Packages
The project should already have the required packages installed (Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap, React Icons, React Router, etc.) based on the package.json. However, if you need to install them manually, use the following commands:

a. Install Bootstrap and React-Bootstrap

npm install bootstrap react-bootstrap
b. Install React Router DOM
npm install react-router-dom
c. Install React Icons
npm install react-icons
6. Start the Development Server
After installing the dependencies, start the project by running:


npm start
This will start the development server, and the project will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
